# ND_north_star
Explore higher dimensional data and determine the optimal path to get to a target point/region (north star)



# Dataset
This project uses 2D-Perlin noise (typically for terrain map generation in videogames) to mimic physical systems that are continuously varying. To simplify the data processing, we round the Perlin noise to 0 or 1 creating "good" or "bad" points respectively.

To create more complex data, we can increase the octaves of the Perlin noise in order to optimize performance across more complex data.
